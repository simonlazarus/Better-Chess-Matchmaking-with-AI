    "# Summary of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we prepare the data from the [last notebook](./01_data_processing.ipynb) to be processed by the chess engine [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) and our machine learning algorithms.  We properly format the strings representing game histories, then we verify that all such formatted histories can be properly read.  In the process, we run through some example games and demonstrate how to get Stockfish evaluations and \"top moves\" for each of the positions in the game.  We also test how long it takes for Stockfish to extract all the information we need from these games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we drop those games that took fewer than 10 turns to complete.  We then reorganize the information in our dataframes into a more convenient format.  Finally, we perform a train/test/validate split on our data and export the split, prepared data as CSV files."

    "## A note on using Stockfish to evaluate human players' moves\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use Stockfish to evaluate a new player's moves and positions in her first game.  We will then use these move and position evaluations, along with information about the new player's upcoming opponent, to predict the results of her *2nd game*.  Thus, it is essential that we can obtain reasonably accurate evaluations of the positions and moves made in the new player's first game.  However, the way in which Stockfish evaluates moves and positions can vary greatly depending on how one sets its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize Stockfish with default parameters (other than those relating to CPU and memory usage) and a search depth of 15 - the default value.  Table 8 of [this paper](https://web.ist.utl.pt/diogo.ferreira/papers/ferreira13impact.pdf) reports that this makes Stockfish's strength approximately equivalent to a player with an Elo rating of 2563 (95% confidence interval = \\[2498, 2623\\]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stockfish does not evaluate positions in exactly the same way that a human does, and hence it does not generally play in the same way that a human would: it often prefers \"risky\" moves that may yield high payoffs *assuming you (Stockfish) play perfectly over the course of the next several moves*, whereas a human player at a similar Elo rating would typically prefer a \"safer\" move that may not have as much upside potential but guarantees a reasonably good payoff even if you do not play perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Elo/Glicko score of about 2400 represents [approximately the top 1% of players on Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/stat/rating/distribution/rapid).  Thus, using Stockfish with a search depth of 15 (Elo a little over 2500) equates to a player that is overall stronger than the vast majority of human players, but not stronger than all human players.  We estimate that using a search depth of 15 will be a *reasonable* way to evaluate the moves and positions of typical human players; indeed, this is perhaps why a search depth of 15 is the default value."

    "These moves are listed in a format where, when there is no ambiguity, they only specify the *target square* to which a piece is moving.  For example, the opening move \"e4\" could more expansively be written out as \"e2e4\" (the piece that was on square e2 moved to square e4), but it is recorded as simply \"e4\" since the piece on e2 (the king's pawn) is the only piece that could have moved to e4 from the opening board state.\n",

Near the end of the game, these scores transition into \"moves until checkmate\" numbers; for example, a score of \"#1\" means \"White can checkmate in 1 move\" and a score of \"#-3\" means \"Black can checkmate in 3 moves.\"  This games might also contain further notation, such as question marks (?) or exclamation marks (!) in certain combinations denoting whether Stockfish thinks a move was unexpected, strong, etc.\n",
